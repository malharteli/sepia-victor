=======================
CONTRACT
=======================

- SHOW UP ON TIME.
- 10:30am and 5:30pm stand up.
- OVER communicate, OVER plan
- Comment each function BEFORE you start coding
  Each function requires three comments.
    1. What the function receives
    2. What the function is supposed to do
    3. What the function returns
- Pairs rotate per task/feature
- Communicate Early and Communicate Often
- Equal time spent coding
- Google StackOverflow BEFORE you code.
- When a pair completes a component, that pair must create a pull request, and the OTHER team must review and merge to master
- Keep features/task small (around a day per task)
- Weekends are good for bug-fixing and polish- NOT new features
- Respect the master
- Code unto others, as you would code unto yourself
